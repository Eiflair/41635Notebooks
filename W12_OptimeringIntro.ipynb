    "### Some basic thoughts\n",
    "Following the theme of the course, design optimisation can be understood as an automatic exploration of the available parametric design space. While a simulation model evaluates a previously chosen layout solution based on the design variables, design parameters, and the corresponding constraints, the optimization algorithm decides how to move through the parametric design space to optain an optimal solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, optimisation is a direct continuation of the previous tasks in the the overall design process, usually following the sequence below:\n",
    "- _Define the system_\n",
    "- _Formulate the optimisation problem_\n",
    "- _Create the model_\n",
    "- _Explore the design space_\n",
    "- _Find the optimal solution_\n",

    "\n",
    "### Modelling of optimisation problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One question when moving from abstract to more detailed embodiment solutions is consequently how to represent the design task in mathematical form, or, in other words, how much design freedom can be represented in a single model. This has the following implications: [1] a suitable mathematical representation referes to a lot of details and comes late in the design process, [2] the modelling process should be structure, and [3] a chosen mathamtical description is not necessarily applicable across different system layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most general way of structuring is the differentation between _Objectives_, _Design variables_ , Parameters , and _constraints_ , all directly following from your previous design decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Objective(s):__ (what do you want to maximise/minimize?)\n",
    "- __Design variables:__ (what can you modify?)\n",
    "- __Parameters:__ (what are you assuming fixed?)\n",
    "- __Constraints:__ (what restrictions do you have?)\n",

    "### Optimisation in Calculus\n",
    "For simple cases, optimisation is the process of finding maximum and minimum values given constraints using calculus. In this sense, optimisation is existing since decades, and has traditionally used graphical methods to find maximum or minimum of a multivariate function. However, a graphical representations is useful for 3-4 dimensions and breaks down afterwards. \n",

    "we can use the first and the second derivative to search for optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Meaning of the first derivative\n",
    "The first derivative of the function $f(x)$ is the slope of the tangent line to the function at the point $x$ and tells us whether a function is increasing or decreasing, and by how much it is increasing or decreasing. For a contiuous function, a positive slope tells us that, as $x$ increases, $f(x)$ also increases and vice versa. Zero slope does not tell us anything in particular: the function may be increasing, decreasing, or at a local maximum or a local minimum at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second derivative test\n",
    "In combination with the second derivative, we, however, can establish whether we have found a (local) maximum or minimum. It \n",
    "holds that:\n",

    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "& \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 f}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} > 0 \\text{ at } x \\text{, then } f(x) \\text{ is concave up} \\\\\n",
    "& \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 f}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} < 0 \\quad \\text{ at } x \\text{, then } f(x) \\text{ is concave down} \\\\\n",

    "In reality, design optimisation is of course not a one-, but rather a multidimensional task that usually involves a wide array of different design variables, and, even more importantly, is depending largely on the existing constraints for the design problem. These may be either imposed by the customer and/or are resulting from the embodiment of the technical solutions, i.e., loading capacity, fit constraints in assemblies, etc. More often than not the optimum is therefore not a question of maxima/minima but rather depending on the activity of constraints!\n",

Each unit of product $x$ requires 3 units of resource $R_1$ and 8 units of resource $R_2$. Each unit of product $y$ requires 6 units of resource $R1$ and 4 units of resource $R2$. The company has a maximum of of resource available $R_{1,max}=30$ and $R_{2,max}=44$ and sells the products for $x_p=100$ and $y_p=125$.
