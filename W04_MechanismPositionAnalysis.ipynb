    "# Graphical Position Analysis\n",
    "While the first part of [course 41635](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/) is mainly focusing on the *Predictability* phase, i.e., driven by the questions how to choose a suitable mechanism and how to ensure its predictable behaviour, a full evaluation of the mechanism of course requires a more detailed, quantitative approach. The following overview therefore provides a first glimpse towards the more quantitative description of simple mechanism, here a planar 4 bar linkage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following fundamental literature, e.g., *Myszka (2012) - Machines & Mechanisms* or also the nice summary provided in [Mechanism Position Analysis](https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=anis/files/week04-mdp206-position_analysis-draft.pdf), the first step of a mechanism analysis is a graphical representation. As stated in the above referenced slidedeck, this \"graphical analysis of the problem is trivial and can be done using only high school geometry of the linkage\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the notation defines four links 1 (frame), 2 (input link), 3 (coupler), 4 (output link) and the corresponding angles $\\Theta_1$ (angle of the frame, i.e. $\\Theta_1 = 0$), $\\Theta_2$ (angle between frame and input link), $\\Theta_3$ (angle of the coupler), and $\\Theta_4$ (angle between frame and output link), as also shown in the figure below. Hereby, please note that a 4 bar linkage has two possible configurations given by the *open* and the *crossed* setup.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is important to consider that not all length combinations, i.e, $a, b, c, d$ as shown in the image on the right, are allowing for a crank movement (a full rotation) of the input arm or are leading to a feasible mechanism at all. For more on this question, see also the course material from [Week 3](https://learn.inside.dtu.dk/)."

    "# Algebraic Position Analysis\n",
    "Based on the graphical representation, different mechanism types can be analysed based on the corresponding vector-loop equations. For the 4 bar linkage the corresponding vector loop $R_2+R_3-R_4-R_1=0$ is visualised in the image below.     \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1T0FrmfllmJ8VHouGVCyH1X33CUXrdyYw\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the fundamental trigonometry of the problem, and disregarding the general description of the vector loop in complex numbers, it correspondingly follows that:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " a\\cos\\Theta_2+b\\cos\\Theta_3-c\\cos\\Theta_4-d = 0\\\\\n",
    " a\\sin\\Theta_2+b\\sin\\Theta_3-c\\sin\\Theta_4 = 0  \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, the problem includes two equations for the two unknow angles $\\theta_3 , \\theta_4$. Herby, the angle $\\Theta_2$ is considered as the input, e.g. a motor driving the mechanism. Solving the problem requires some algebraic manipulation, which is described in more detail in [Mechanism Position Analysis](https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/?q=anis/files/week04-mdp206-position_analysis-draft.pdf) and covered by the script below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script is currently providing an animation based on the specified input parameters and a full rotation of the input link (a crank mechanism). But please feel free of course to adapt towards other type of inputs, towards plotting the angles in dependency of time, to include tolerances and calculate specific deviation of relevant points of interest, etc."
